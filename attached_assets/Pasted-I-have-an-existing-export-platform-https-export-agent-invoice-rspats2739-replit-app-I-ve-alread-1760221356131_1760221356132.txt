I have an existing export platform: https://export-agent-invoice-rspats2739.replit.app
.
I’ve already upgraded the core structure in Phase 1.

Now I want to upgrade it to Phase 2, focusing on monetization, AI-powered automation, and B2B marketplace features to build this into a $100M+ export platform.

💰 1. MONETIZATION SYSTEM

💳 Subscription Plans (Stripe / PayPal Integration)

Free Plan: Limited access (basic invoices + 3 free forms per month)

Pro Plan: Unlimited exports, full AI tools, live support

Business Plan: Team access, marketplace priority listing, advanced analytics

🧾 Payment & billing page for users to upgrade plans easily

🧠 Feature restriction logic (based on plan type)

📢 Automated reminder system when a free plan is about to expire

🏪 2. B2B EXPORT MARKETPLACE

📦 Exporter / Buyer Profiles

Exporters can list products with details (price, country, MOQ, HS code, etc.)

Buyers can browse and contact exporters directly

🌍 Advanced search filters: product category, location, price, HS code

🤝 In-app messaging / inquiry system between buyers & sellers

📊 Exporters can view leads & contact requests in their dashboard

💼 Verified business badge for paid members

🧠 3. AI AUTOMATION TOOLS

🧮 Smart Duty & Tax Calculator for different countries

📝 AI Form Assistant that auto-fills export forms based on product + destination

⚠️ Compliance Checker to warn users of missing or invalid info

✍️ One-click Export Pack — generate all documents for a shipment in one click (invoice, packing list, certificate, declaration, etc.)

🧭 4. DASHBOARD & USER EXPERIENCE

📊 Personalized user dashboard for exporters and buyers

📨 Notification system (in-app + email) for:

New leads

Payment reminders

Shipment status updates

🌐 Responsive, modern UI for desktop & mobile

🧰 Admin panel for managing:

Users

Marketplace listings

Payments

Support tickets

🌎 5. TECH REQUIREMENTS

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Frontend: React.js (Tailwind CSS)

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB

Authentication: JWT / OAuth

Payment Gateway: Stripe or PayPal

AI Tools: OpenAI API or similar (for smart automation)

Deployment: Replit / Render / Vercel / AWS

Code should be modular, clean, and easy to scale.

🧭 6. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO (Replit Agent)

Integrate Stripe or PayPal and implement subscription tiers.

Build a clean B2B marketplace module (listings, search, messaging).

Add AI export tools (form autofill, tax calculator, compliance checker).

Add dashboards for both users & admins.

Add notification system + clean UI/UX.

Write clean, scalable code that allows Phase 3 (global scaling) to be added easily.

Add documentation & clear file structure.

🎯 Final Goal for Phase 2:
Make this platform look and feel like a serious SaaS business with built-in monetization, marketplace, and AI tools, so that it can generate recurring revenue and attract exporters globally.

👉 Please begin implementing these Phase 2 upgrades step by step, starting with subscription plans and marketplace foundation, then layering AI tools and UX improvements.
