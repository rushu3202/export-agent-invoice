PROJECT AUDIT & FULL REBUILD — EXPORTAGENT LTD
Goal: Turn ExportAgent into a polished, fully functional export SaaS platform ready for paid users and high scale.

Tasks (complete the following)

Full Feature Audit & Error Logging
 • Crawl all routes: /, /login, /app/contacts, /app/hs-finder, /app/export-forms, /app/invoices, etc.
 • Log and list broken pages or “blank / not found” UI.
 • Add health endpoint /health returning service status for backend dependencies (OpenAI, Stripe, DB).
 • Add server-side error logging (console or Sentry) and frontend error boundaries.

Contacts / CRM Module
 • Implement full CRUD contacts (backend + frontend) tied to user account.
 • UI: list view, add / edit / delete forms, search filter.
 • Quota enforcement for free vs paid plan.

HS Code Finder
 • Add API endpoint to accept product + country → return HS code, confidence, duty.
 • UI form to input and get result + save history.
 • Enforce usage limits per plan.

Document / Export Forms Module
 • Build or fix modules: invoice, packing list, proforma, certificate of origin.
 • UI to select type, input details, preview & generate PDF.
 • Save document metadata and history.
 • Download / email / reprint options.

Navigation, UI & Styling
 • Uniform header + sidebar menu for Dashboard, Contacts, HS Finder, Documents, Shipments, Settings.
 • Active link highlight, breadcrumbs.
 • Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
 • Loading spinners, skeletons, error messages on UI.

Settings & Company Info
 • Settings page to allow user to enter/edit: company name, address, logo, default currency, VAT number.
 • These settings should reflect in invoices, footer, documents.

Quota / Usage Limits & Plan Logic
 • Enforce limits in backend (contacts, hs searches, docs) per user’s plan.
 • Return clear error codes (e.g. 402 “quota_exceeded”) if over limit.
 • Frontend must detect that and show “Upgrade” banner or message.

Authentication & Route Protection
 • All /app/* routes should require login. If not authenticated, redirect to login.
 • Protect APIs: reject requests with no token or invalid token.

Health & Monitoring
 • Add a /health endpoint to check dependencies.
 • Add error logging / monitoring for backend (Sentry or custom).

Testing & QA
 • Write tests for contact APIs, HS Finder, document APIs.
 • UI tests: add / edit / delete contacts, HS search, document generation.
 • Edge cases: no data, invalid input, API failure.

Documentation & Clean Architecture
 • Refactor code into modular layers (frontend components, API services, backend controllers).
 • Add comments, write README updates.
 • Document API endpoints: input/output, error codes.

Polish & Brand Trust
 • Add footer with company info on all pages (public + app)
 • Add Terms, Privacy, Contact pages
 • Add trust badges, load speed improvements

Deliverable & Testing

After implementation, run a full manual QA: test every feature.

Provide a “bug report list” with fixed / remaining issues.

Provide instructions to test: contacts, HS Finder, document generation, settings.

Outcome: Every feature works, UI is polished and responsive, plan limits enforced, error states handled, and the app looks like a professional SaaS you can charge for.
