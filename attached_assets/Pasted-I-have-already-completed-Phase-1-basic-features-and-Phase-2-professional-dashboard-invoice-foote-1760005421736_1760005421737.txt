I have already completed Phase 1 (basic features) and Phase 2 (professional dashboard, invoice footer, AI helper, payment integration setup).

Now I want to build Phase 3, which focuses on automation, AI intelligence, smart document generation, and professional business features to make EXPORTAGENT worth paying for as a serious export business platform.

✅ Please build the following:

🧠 1. AI Smart Export Assistant (Advanced Chat)

Upgrade the existing basic chatbot into a smart export assistant that can:

Guide users step-by-step through export procedures (e.g., HS code, Incoterms, documents required per country).

Suggest invoice formats based on destination country.

Answer FAQs like “What documents do I need to export from the UK to Germany?”

Use the OpenAI API (I’ll provide the key in .env).

Display chatbot in a clean widget or chat modal in the dashboard.

Add quick action buttons (e.g., “Required Docs”, “Tax Info”, “HS Code”, “Create Invoice”).

📝 2. Auto-Fill Invoice from Client Database (AI Assist)

When a user selects a saved client, auto-fill the invoice form with previously stored client details (name, address, country, currency, etc.).

Add a “Suggest Item Description” button where AI can generate product descriptions automatically based on a few keywords.

Add option to auto-generate proforma invoice or commercial invoice templates.

🌍 3. Export Document Generator (Very Important)

Add a module to auto-generate standard export documents:

Proforma Invoice

Commercial Invoice

Packing List

Certificate of Origin (template format)

Bill of Lading (basic layout)

User should be able to select the document type → fill in a simple form → generate a clean PDF with the company branding footer.

Save each document in history with date & client name.

🔄 4. Automation Flows

Add “One-Click Export Package” feature: when the user clicks a single button, the system:

Generates all required documents (invoice, packing list, etc.)

Sends them to the client’s email

Saves everything to history.

Optional: Zip all documents in one downloadable file.

📊 5. AI Insights & Smart Alerts

Add a Smart Insights section to the dashboard that shows:

Total invoices this month 📈

Top 3 clients

Most used currency

Total value exported this month

Add simple alerts:

“You haven’t invoiced any client in 7 days”

“Reminder: New invoice due today” (basic reminder system).

📅 6. Task & Reminder System

Add a task list panel in the dashboard where the user can set reminders:

“Send shipping documents to client”

“Book freight forwarder”

“Apply for Certificate of Origin”

Optional: Add email notification for reminders.

💬 7. Multi-Language Support (Optional but powerful)

Add a language selector in the top bar (English by default).

Allow interface translation to at least Hindi, Spanish, and Arabic (static translation file is okay for now).

Invoice templates should support multiple languages (e.g., “Invoice” → “Factura” for Spanish).

🧾 8. Branded PDF Templates

Add 2–3 professional, clean, and elegant PDF invoice/document template designs.

User can select their preferred template in Settings.

All templates must include the company footer, logo, and consistent formatting.

🧑‍💻 9. User Settings Page

Allow the user to edit:

Company name, logo, address, VAT number

Preferred currency

Preferred template design

Preferred language

All settings should auto-apply across invoices and documents.

🔐 10. Subscription & Role System (Optional)

Add a simple subscription structure:

Free Tier: Limited invoices/month

Pro Tier: Unlimited invoices, AI export helper, smart document generator.

Optional: Admin dashboard to view user activity.

Optional: Add basic role system (e.g., admin, staff).

🧰 Tech Notes:

Keep UI clean and fast using React + Tailwind.

Backend: Node.js (Express) + MongoDB.

AI features: OpenAI API.

Authentication: JWT.

Emailing: Nodemailer.

PDF: pdfkit or html-pdf.

🪄 Goal:
Transform EXPORTAGENT from a simple tool into a powerful AI-enabled export management platform with smart features, automation, branded documents, insights, and a smooth user experience that people would pay for.
