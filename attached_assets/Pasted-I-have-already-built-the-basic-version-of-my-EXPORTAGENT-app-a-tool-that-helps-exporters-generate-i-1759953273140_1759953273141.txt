I have already built the basic version of my EXPORTAGENT app (a tool that helps exporters generate invoices, documents, and manage their exports easily).

Now I want to upgrade the app to a more professional, paid-level product.

✅ Please add and build the following Phase 2 features in a clean, responsive UI:

🧾 1. Company Branding & Footer on All Invoices

Add this exact footer to every generated invoice PDF (before doc.end() in server.js):

EXPORTAGENT LTD
Registered in England and Wales
Company No: [Your Company Number]
Registered Address: [Your Registered Office Address]
VAT (if registered): [leave blank until registered]


The footer should appear neatly at the bottom of every invoice.

🌐 2. Professional Website Footer

In public/index.html or React footer component, paste the same footer.

Make the footer look clean, centered, with a small font.

Add social icons (LinkedIn, Instagram, Email).

👤 3. Dashboard Upgrade

Add a professional-looking dashboard with:

Total invoices generated 📊

Total revenue 💰

Quick action buttons (New Invoice, View All Invoices, Export Data).

Use cards and simple charts for analytics (Recharts or Chart.js).

📁 4. Export Client Data & Invoice History

Allow the user to view all previous invoices.

Add a “Download CSV” or “Download Excel” button to export invoice history.

Store client details (Name, Company, Country, Email).

💳 5. Add Stripe Payment Integration (Optional for future)

Add a “Pay Now” button on the invoice PDF or invoice page.

Integrate Stripe Checkout for easy payment collection from buyers.

🧠 6. AI Smart Export Helper (Basic Chat)

Add a simple AI chatbot box in the dashboard that can answer exporters’ basic questions (e.g., “How to create an invoice for Germany?”).

For now, just connect to OpenAI API (I will provide the API key in .env).

🌍 7. Multi-Currency & Tax Handling

Add currency dropdown in invoice form (USD, GBP, EUR, INR).

Add tax field (e.g., 0%, 5%, 20%) and calculate total accordingly.

Show total amount with and without tax.

📨 8. Automatic Email Sending of Invoices

After invoice is generated, send the PDF to the client’s email (use Nodemailer).

Email subject: Your Invoice from EXPORTAGENT LTD.

Email body: “Dear [Client Name], Please find attached your invoice.”

🔐 9. Login / Signup Page (Basic Auth)

Add simple authentication system (email & password).

Users can log in to see their own invoices.

Use JWT or any simple auth method.

💻 10. Clean & Modern UI Design

Keep everything simple, fast and mobile friendly.

Use Tailwind CSS or any clean UI library.

Use exportagent branding (blue & white theme).

📎 Tech Stack Notes:

Frontend: React

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Database: MongoDB or JSON file (whichever is easiest to implement)

PDF Generator: pdfkit

Email: Nodemailer

Auth: JWT (basic)

💬 Please build this step by step, cleanly structured with comments so I can understand the code.

🪄 Goal:
Upgrade EXPORTAGENT into a professional export invoicing & assistance platform with dashboard, branding, client management, invoice history, currency support, and simple AI help — so I can charge users for using it.
