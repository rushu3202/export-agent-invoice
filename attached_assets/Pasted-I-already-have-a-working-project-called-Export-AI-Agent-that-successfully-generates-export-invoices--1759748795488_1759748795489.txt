I already have a working project called Export AI Agent that successfully generates export invoices with PDF downloads.
I now want to upgrade this project into a fully professional, ready-to-sell AI-powered export automation platform.

The goal is to make this app look, feel, and function like a real SaaS tool that exporters can use to automate all documentation, tracking, and payments.
It should be visually polished, fully working, and ready to publish at the end.

🌍 1. App Overview

Build a web application called Export AI Agent with the following main sections in the navigation bar:

Dashboard

Invoice Generator

Export Forms Assistant

Shipment Tracker

AI Chat Assistant

Profile / Billing

Use React + TailwindCSS + Shadcn/UI for a clean, modern interface (professional export business look).
The layout should have a sidebar with icons, a top navigation bar, and light-blue/white theme colors.

🧾 2. Invoice Generator (Already Working)

Keep the current working invoice generation flow.

Improve UI with labeled input boxes, currency dropdown (USD, GBP, INR, EUR).

Auto-assign unique invoice numbers and dates.

When generating the PDF:

Include company branding (Export AI Agent logo).

Add a footer “Generated by Export AI Agent v1.0”.

After PDF generation, increment the invoice count on the Dashboard.

🧠 3. Smart AI Layer (HS Code & Duty Intelligence)

Add backend endpoint /analyze-invoice that uses AI to:

Identify HS Codes for each item.

Estimate duties, freight, and insurance (mock or GPT-4-powered).

Add short “Export Declaration Summary” at the bottom of the invoice.

Use OpenAI API (you can leave a placeholder for API key).

If OpenAI API key isn’t added, fallback to mock HS codes and duty data.

📦 4. Export Forms Assistant

Add new page “Export Forms Assistant” with tabs for:

Packing List

Shipping Bill

Certificate of Origin

Each form should accept basic details like:

Exporter, Consignee, Items, Port, Mode of Transport, Date.

AI fills the rest automatically and generates downloadable PDFs for each.

🚢 5. Shipment Tracker

Create a Shipment Tracker page that:

Lets users enter a shipment ID.

Displays mock live status:

📦 Booked → 🚢 In Transit → ✅ Delivered.

Optionally use a simulated progress bar or timeline UI component.

💬 6. AI Chat Assistant

Add a chat interface (like ChatGPT) where users can ask:

“How to apply for IEC code?”

“What is HS code for garments?”

“Steps to file shipping bill online?”

Use GPT-4 API (placeholder key allowed).

Keep previous chat history visible in the chat window.

📊 7. Dashboard Page

Display live statistics:

Total Invoices Generated

Export Forms Completed

AI Queries Asked

Include charts or counters using Recharts or Chart.js.

Add quick links to “Generate New Invoice” and “Open Chat Assistant.”

💳 8. User Accounts & Billing (Phase 3 Integration)

Add simple authentication system (email + password).

Store user data, invoices, and stats in Supabase or MongoDB.

Add a Stripe payment integration for premium features:

Free Plan → 3 invoices/month

Pro Plan (£9.99/month) → Unlimited access

Add a billing page where users can view their plan, usage, and upgrade.

💅 9. Branding & Polish

Title: Export AI Agent

Tagline: “Automate Your Exports with Intelligence”

Footer: “© 2025 Export AI Agent · Built with ❤️ by Rushaleeben Patel”

Logo suggestion: A cargo ship + AI brain icon (blue & white theme)

🧰 10. Deployment & Output

Make sure everything builds successfully and runs smoothly.

Use Express for backend APIs, React Vite for frontend.

Ensure /generate-invoice, /analyze-invoice, /generate-form, /track-shipment endpoints all return proper JSON or files.

The app should be fully functional and ready for Replit publish.

🏁 Final Goal

The result should look and feel like a real AI SaaS product for exporters.

Include working features, clean design, responsive layout, and ready-to-demo links.

I should be able to send this app to an investor or a real exporter and have them use it instantly.

Please make this entire project production-ready, visually professional, and fully deployable under the domain:
